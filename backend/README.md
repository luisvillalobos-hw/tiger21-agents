# Deal Sourcing Agent

## Overview

The Deal Sourcing Agent is a team of specialized AI agents that discovers investment opportunities through coordinated search across real estate and financial markets.

1. **Real Estate Agent**: This agent searches for commercial real estate investment opportunities including multifamily properties, office buildings, retail spaces, and industrial properties. It uses Google Search to find listings on platforms like LoopNet, CREXi, and other commercial real estate sites, gathering information on cap rates, NOI, square footage, and investment metrics.

2. **Financial News Agent**: This agent searches for business deals, M&A opportunities, partnerships, and funding rounds. It searches financial news sources like Bloomberg, Reuters, Financial Times, and TechCrunch to identify investment opportunities, analyzing deal valuations, strategic rationales, and market trends.

3. **Deal Coordinator Agent**: This agent synthesizes results from both the Real Estate and Financial News agents, prioritizing opportunities based on investment attractiveness, strategic value, and alignment with user preferences. It resolves overlaps, identifies cross-sector themes, and prepares coordinated insights.

4. **Risk Analyst Agent**: This agent generates comprehensive risk assessments and professional PDF-ready reports for stakeholder decision-making. It evaluates the overall risk profile of discovered opportunities, assesses individual deal risks, and provides actionable investment strategy recommendations.

   * uv (modern Python package manager)
     * For installation, follow instructions at [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

   * A project on Google Cloud Platform
   * Google Cloud CLI
     * For installation, please follow the instruction on the official [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

2. **Installation**

   ```bash
   # Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
   cd adk-samples/python/agents/deal-sourcing

   # Install dependencies using uv
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Configuration**

   * Set up Google Cloud credentials:

     * You may set the following environment variables in your shell, or in a `.env` file instead.

     ```bash
     export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
     export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<your-project-id>
     export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=<your-project-location>
     export GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=<your-storage-bucket>  # Only required for deployment
     ```

   * Authenticate your GCloud account:

     ```bash
     gcloud auth application-default login
     gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT

## Running the Agent

**Using `adk` with uv**

ADK provides convenient ways to bring up agents locally and interact with them.
You may talk to the agent using the CLI:

```bash
uv run adk run deal_sourcing
```

Or on a web interface:

```bash
uv run adk web
```

The command `uv run adk web` will start a web server on your machine and print the URL.
You may open the URL (typically http://127.0.0.1:8000), select "deal_sourcing" in the top-left drop-down menu, and
a chatbot interface will appear on the right.
