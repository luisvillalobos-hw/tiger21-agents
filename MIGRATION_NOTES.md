# Migration from Google ADK to CrewAI

## Summary

Successfully refactored the investment opportunity analysis system from Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) to CrewAI framework with the following improvements:

## 🔄 Key Changes

### Architecture Migration
- **From**: Google ADK agents with single-file structure
- **To**: CrewAI multi-agent system with modular architecture

### Model Configuration
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Used for complex thinking tasks (Deal Coordinator, Risk Analyst)
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: Used for search and simple tasks (Real Estate, Financial News agents)
- Optimized model selection based on task complexity

### Framework Benefits
- **Better orchestration**: Sequential task execution with proper dependencies
- **Memory integration**: Agents maintain context across tasks
- **Tool integration**: Flexible search tool configuration
- **Scalability**: Easier to add new agents and capabilities

## 📁 New Structure

│   ├── agents/           # CrewAI agent definitions
│   ├── tasks/           # Task definitions with detailed prompts
│   ├── tools/           # Search and utility tools

├── agents_old/          # Backup of original ADK agents
└── README_CREWAI.md     # Comprehensive usage guide
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Test setup
uv run python test_setup.py

# Run analysis
uv run python main.py
```

### Custom Analysis
```python
from src.crew import InvestmentOpportunityCrew

crew = InvestmentOpportunityCrew()
result = crew.run_analysis(
    search_criteria="your real estate criteria",
    deal_interests="your business deal interests",
    industry_focus="target industries"
)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_search_key  # Optional but recommended
```

### Model Selection
- Complex analysis tasks automatically use Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Search and data collection use Gemini 1.5 Flash for efficiency

## 💡 Improvements Over ADK Version

1. **Better Task Dependencies**: Sequential execution ensures data flows correctly between agents
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Proper prerequisite checking and error messages
3. **Flexible Search**: Multiple search backend options (Serper, Google Custom Search)
4. **Memory Integration**: Agents maintain context and can reference previous results
5. **Professional Output**: Structured reporting suitable for stakeholders
6. **Easy Testing**: Built-in test suite to verify setup

## 🔍 Agent Roles Preserved

All original agent functionality has been preserved and enhanced:

- **Real Estate Agent**: Commercial property search and analysis
- **Financial News Agent**: Business deals and M&A opportunity discovery
- **Deal Coordinator**: Cross-sector opportunity synthesis and prioritization
- **Risk Analyst**: Comprehensive risk assessment and professional reporting

## 📊 Output Quality

The new system generates the same comprehensive reports as the original but with:
- Better formatting and structure
- More detailed risk analysis
- Cross-sector insights
- Professional stakeholder-ready format
- Actionable implementation recommendations

## ⚠️ Migration Notes

- Original agents backed up to `agents_old/` directory
- All original prompts and logic preserved in new task definitions
- Enhanced with better error handling and validation
- Search tools now support multiple backends for reliability

The migration successfully preserves all original functionality while providing a more robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture using CrewAI's advanced multi-agent capabilities.
